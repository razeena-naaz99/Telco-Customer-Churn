# Telco-Customer-Churn
In this model we predict behavior to retain customers by analyzing all the relevant customer data. Customers who left within the last month are recorded in the column Churn. Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies and Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges and Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents have been analyzed.
